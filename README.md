FLLOWINGS ARE THE DERSCRIPTION ABOUT HOTEL MANAGEMENT APPLICATION-----

1. **Room Bookings Table**: This project incorporates a Room Bookings table within the ServiceNow platform, serving as a central repository for room booking requests from users.

2. **Create New Module**: The "Create New" module features a highly intuitive form for room bookings, designed with real-time business properties. This form ensures seamless interaction for customers, enhancing user experience.

3. **Client Scripts for Dynamic Population**: Through client scripts such as "Requested For Onload" and "FetchingEmailFromOnLoad", this form dynamically populates user details like the logged-in username and email address, ensuring accuracy and convenience.

4. **Date Validation**: To prevent erroneous date selections, business rules like 'From date should not precede To date' and 'From and To date past validation' have been implemented, enhancing data integrity and user experience.

5. **Dynamic Field Visibility and Population**: Utilizing UI policies, fields adapt dynamically based on user inputs. For instance, displaying a 'Business Justification' field when the number of guests exceeds a certain threshold, or automatically populating the number of rooms based on the guest count, streamlining the booking process.

6. **Module Filtering**: Modules like 'Open Requests' filter records based on their state, ensuring users can easily track and manage pending requests.

7. **Workflow Automation**: The 'Hotel Management Approval' workflow automates the approval process, creating tasks upon manager approval, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.

8. **Data Import and Transformation**: A 'Room Booking Transform Map' ensures seamless data import, with scripting capabilities to handle discrepancies, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.

9. **Priority Management**: This project includes mechanisms such as the 'high_to_critical' event and script action to dynamically adjust priority levels, enhancing task prioritization and management. When the priority of the record changes to high, it automatically changes to critical, ensuring prompt attention to critical tasks.

10. **Automated Notifications**: The schedule script 'Count of Records High and Open' sends notifications ('emailChangeInActivity') to users who created the request record, containing all the details like priority, state, from and to date. It also includes a link for users to change the priority of the request. If the user clicks the link, a request mail will be sent to the manager of the user to change the priority of the request to low. This streamlines communication and ensures timely action on critical tasks.

11. **Email Integration**: Inbound email actions like 'Change state from Reply' and 'lowPriority' automate tasks such as populating description fields from emails and adjusting priority levels based on email content, improving workflow efficiency.

12. **Portal Development**: The creation of the 'Refresher' portal enriches user experience, offering features such as hotel image galleries, service catalog search functionality, room booking management, request approval, and note-taking capabilities, consolidating all hotel management tasks in a user-friendly interface.

In summary, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to hotel management leveraging the capabilities of the ServiceNow platform, encompassing everything from intuitive form design to workflow automation and portal development, ultimately enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and user satisfaction.
